        Hello, my name is <b>Yoshikage Kira</b>. I'm <time datetime="1992-06-06">33 years old</time>. <br>
        My house is in the <i>northeast section of <mark>Morioh</mark></i>, where all the villas are, and I am <u>not married</u>. <br>
        I work as an employee for the <b>Kame Yu</b> department stores, and I get home every day by <time datetime="20:00">8 PM</time> at the latest. <br>
        I don't smoke, but I occasionally <em>drink</em>. I'm in bed by <b>11 PM</b>, and make sure I get <i>eight hours of sleep</i>, no matter what. <br>
      </p>

      <aside>
        After having a glass of <strong>warm milk</strong> and doing about 
        <u>twenty minutes of stretches</u> before going to bed, 
        I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.

        <p>
          Just like a baby, I wake up without any <abbr title="Stress or Fatigue">issues</abbr> in the morning.  
          I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.  
          I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very <cite>quiet life</cite>. <br>
          I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.  
          That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. <br>
          Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
